                My name is Enoch and after considerable research, i have come to find out that the only difference
                beteween genius and those who consider themselves dummies is 'mindset'.
                Yes, yes, you might have heard of this several times but ill advise you to stick around, if something
                here struck your interest.
                Every one of our decision is influenced by the subconscious mind and that subconscious mind is also
                affected by your thoughts as well and what you experience and once you start believing
                you can do this, you will realize you really can do it.

                Einstein, Newton, Avogadro, Antonio and many other genius were humans, these people had the same cells
                as you, the same brain structure as a baby,
                what mattered is how they developed themselves. From similar categories with their peers, they built and
                modified themselves to become historical genius.

                One mistake people tend to make is that, its too late and that's the worst idea a human being can ever
                have, its never too late, regardless of your age.

                So, start modifying yourself, start now.
